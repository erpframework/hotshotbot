ABOUT HotShotBot
-----------
HotShotBot is an AIML based Chat Bot written in C# -- a computer program you can talk to.  He
is designed to be portable (No need of installation).

HotShotBot is actually a very simple AIML Bot which actually designed to help you to create
your very first AIML Chatbot in C#.

HotShotBot IS HELPFUL:
---------------------
HotShotBot is able to answer most questions of the form "Who/what/where/when 
is/was/are/were X?" -- though his answers are occasionally more
entertaining than accurate. He can also help find the meaning of some  acronyms.

IT CAN SPEAK:
------------
Currently this feature is being served by using Microsoft Speech Recognition (Microsoft.Speech).

FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS:
--------------------
I'm also planning to make it able to take speech input,but reliability is a concern .
He should someday be able to provide definitions or 
synonyms for any word in the dictionary, query your address book, and even
perform a few simple remote system-administration tasks!


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
HotShotBot has been tested on Windows 10,Windows 8,Windows 8.1.However,
he should work on any Microsoft system(or you can also use mono on linux):
 - .NET Framework
 - Enough available RAM (depending on the AIML set you're using)
 

NOTE: HotShotBot doesn't require any installation.You can directly run the "HotShotBot.exe" file and enjoy the show.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
----------------
The Win32 installer was produced using the Nullsoft Install System
(http://www.nullsoft.com/free/nsis/).

HotShotBot's conversational back-end is provided by AIMLbot.dll
(http://aimlbot.sourceforge.net), a C# implementation of Dr. Richard S.
Wallace's A.L.I.C.E. system. For more information about the A.L.I.C.E.
Foundation (including information on AIML, the Artificial Intelligence
Markup Language used to program HotShotBot's responses), visit the A.L.I.C.E.
